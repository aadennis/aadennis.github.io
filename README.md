# Dennis's Travel Blog Starter

This is a simple Jekyll site starter using the minima theme, ready for GitHub Pages.

### To use this:
1. Create a repo named  `aadennis.github.io` on GitHub (replace 'aadennis' with your GitHub username).
2. Upload these files to the root of the repo.
3. In GitHub repo Settings > Pages, set source branch to `main` and folder to `/ (root)`.
4. Wait a few minutes, then visit `https://aadennis.github.io`.

You can edit or add `.md` files for new pages.
